# Testing

Three layers.

| Layer                  | Where                | Runner                                  | Count today |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------:|
| Solidity unit + fuzz   | `ens-contracts/`     | `npx vitest run`                        | 119 SNRC + upstream ENS suite |
| Frontend unit          | `ens-app-v3/`        | `pnpm test`                             | varies (ENS upstream) |
| End-to-end (Hardhat)   | parent repo          | `npx playwright test --project=simplex` | 25 |

## Solidity unit tests

The SNRC-specific suites live under `ens-contracts/test/simplex/` — **119 tests
across 6 files**:

| File                            | Tests | Covers |
|---------------------------------|------:|--------|
| `TestSimplexController.test.ts` | 80 | commit-reveal (happy + too-early/too-late), NFT gate, reserved-name flows, `setMinCharLength` monotonic guard, `disableNftGate` one-way guard, pricing/oracle swap + freeze, `onlyOwner` access control |
| `TestRegistrarV3.test.ts`       | 18 | `registerWithLabel`/`labelOf`, ERC721Enumerable, `tokenURI`/renderer hook, `maxLabelLength`, auto-reclaim on transfer, `onReregister` |
| `TestSubnameRegistrar.test.ts`  | 12 | `createSubname`/`deleteSubname`/`purge`, `ownerOf` walk-up, generation GC, `getChildren` index |
| `TestMetadataRenderer.test.ts`  | 7  | on-chain JSON+SVG output, escaping |
| `FuzzSubnameRegistrar.test.ts`  | 1  | fuzz: subname create/delete/purge invariants |
| `FuzzMetadataRenderer.test.ts`  | 1  | fuzz: label escaping never breaks JSON/SVG |

Run:

```bash
cd ens-contracts
npx vitest run                    # SNRC + the full upstream ENS suite
npx vitest run test/simplex       # just our additions (119)
```

What's **not** covered in-contract today:

- A single integration test that walks the full lifecycle (register → set records
  → transfer → renew → expire → re-register at premium → create subname → admin
  ops). Parts of this are covered cross-layer by the e2e suite (registration +
  records + admin); the renew / expire paths are only in the per-contract unit
  suites above. (v3 is wrapper-free — there is no wrap path.)
- Formal coverage measurement. The plan target was >90% line coverage on
  `SimplexController`; `npx hardhat coverage` hasn't been run against the SNRC
  branch yet.

## Frontend unit tests

The ens-app-v3 fork keeps the upstream vitest suite (`pnpm test`) running for the
parts we didn't touch. Most of our additions are exercised by the e2e suite
instead — there are no SNRC-specific frontend unit tests today.

## End-to-end (Playwright)

**25 tests** in `test/e2e/simplex-flow.spec.ts` in the parent repo. They share one
Hardhat instance and one Next.js dev server (`./scripts/run-local.sh`).

Each test is written to run individually against a fresh chain. A few mutate
controller state (admin lowering `minCharLength`, `disableNftGate`,
`addReservedNames`/`removeReservedNames`) and are placed late in the file so
earlier tests see a clean state. Seven tests **adapt to the current chain state**:
they read `minCharLength` / `nftGateEnabled` first and either parametrise or
`test.skip` (e.g. skip an NFT-gate assertion once a previous test has disabled the
gate) rather than asserting the initial deploy values verbatim.

Run:

```bash
# from the parent repo, with the stack already running
npx playwright test --project=simplex

# single test
npx playwright test --grep "search shows name as available"
```

### Test catalogue

| Test | What it asserts |
|------|-----------------|
| homepage loads and shows search | The search box renders |
| search appends .testing TLD | Bare label auto-appends the configured TLD |
| search with connected wallet does not crash | Smoke test for the wallet-injected variant |
| search shows name as available | An unregistered name surfaces the `Available` tag |
| clicking available name navigates to registration | Search → `/register/<name>.testing` |
| full registration flow: commit and register | The whole UI commit/register flow ends with the view-name button |
| admin panel: view state and manage settings | `/admin` shows controller state + owner-only sections |
| set simplex.contact during registration profile step | Records added during registration are written on-chain |
| set simplex.contact after registration via profile editor | Records added via the profile editor are written + displayed |
| registration fails for an account without the SMPX NFT | `register()` reverts for a non-holder (contract-level) — *skips if the gate is already off* |
| search marks too-short names with the controller minimum | Search tag shows live `Min N chars` |
| my names lists a name registered by the connected wallet | `/my/names` chain-scan fallback returns the registered name |
| registration pricing page hides USD tiers and credit-card option on .testing | On `.testing` the USD tier cards + card-payment option are hidden |
| admin lowers min char length and registers a name at the new floor | Reads current min, lowers by 1, registers at the new floor — *parametric; skips if min < 2* |
| NFT-gate banner shows and Next is disabled when an NFT-less wallet reaches /register directly | Banner + disabled Next on `.testing` — *skips if the gate is off* |
| on .testing, a 4-char name shows zero registration cost (free pricing) | The all-zero `.testing` oracle yields a zero-cost invoice |
| attempting to register a reserved name shows a clear reserved banner | Reserved-name flow: dropdown shows `Reserved`, register page shows banner + disabled Next |
| admin disables NFT gate, then a non-NFT-holder can register | Contract-level: `disableNftGate` then a non-holder commits + registers |
| reserved name reverts; admin unreserves; same name can then be registered | Contract-level: reserved → revert; admin removes; succeeds |
| homepage shows yellow NFT-gate banner for a wallet without an SMPXNFT | Homepage banner for a gate-blocked wallet — *skips if the gate is off* |
| clicking an available name without NFT shows the SMPXNFT toast and does not navigate | Search gate: blocked toast, no nav — *skips if the gate is off* |
| clicking a reserved name shows the reserved toast even when the wallet holds the NFT | Reserved check fires regardless of NFT holding |
| direct nav to /&lt;too-short&gt;.testing/register stays on the page with a disabled "Name too short" button | Too-short guard on the register route — *skips if minChar ≤ 1* |
| direct nav to /&lt;too-short&gt;.testing (profile) renders the yellow "too short" warning | Too-short guard on the profile route — *skips if minChar ≤ 1* |
| .testing register page hides pricing tiers and the credit-card payment option | `.testing` register UI hides USD tiers + card payment |

## Running everything

```bash
# Solidity + ENS upstream
cd ens-contracts && npx vitest run

# Stack + Playwright e2e (Hardhat-backed)
cd ..
./scripts/run-local.sh                 # in one terminal
npx playwright test --project=simplex  # in another
```

## Manual UI testing

From `ens-app-v3`.

### Against mainnet (`.testing`)

The `.testing` NFT gate is disabled and pricing is zero, so any wallet can
register for gas only.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_NAME=mainnet \
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIMPLEX_TLD=testing \
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_DEPLOYMENT_ADDRESSES="$(node -e "process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('../deployments.mainnet.testing.json','utf8'))))")" \
pnpm dev
```

## Gotchas

- **Port hygiene** — Next.js falls back to 3001 / 3002 / 3003 when 3000 is busy
  from a zombie process. The Playwright config hits port 3000 only; always kill
  stragglers between runs:
  ```bash
  lsof -ti :3000 :3001 :3002 :3003 :8545 | xargs -r kill -9
  ```
- **Hardhat chain time drift** — `evm_increaseTime` only moves forward. The
  full-registration test re-syncs `page.clock` to the post-advance block
  timestamp; skip that and the CountdownCircle's wall-clock check stays in the
  past and the finish button never enables.
- **Compile flow** — the frontend reads contract ABIs from
  `ens-contracts/artifacts/` at deploy time. If you change a contract, run
  `npx hardhat compile` before `./scripts/run-local.sh`.
- **State pollution** — the seven adaptive tests read `minCharLength` /
  `nftGateEnabled` and either parametrise or skip. The non-adaptive
  registrar-state tests can still leave names registered on the chain; if you
  re-run a test that uses a fixed label, restart the stack to get a clean
  `BaseRegistrar`.

The longer running list of build-time gotchas lives in `CLAUDE.md` at the repo
root.
