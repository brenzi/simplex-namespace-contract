# SNRC v3 — security review & accepted risks

Review dates: 2026-06-14 (initial) and 2026-07-09 (independent re-review on the
Fable model — see the dated section at the end). Scope: the wrapper-free v3
contracts that differ from upstream ENS, plus the deploy scripts. The `.testing`
TLD is now live on mainnet; findings whose status changed with deployment reality
are called out in the re-review.

- `ens-contracts/contracts/ethregistrar/BaseRegistrarImplementation.sol` (v3 changes)
- `ens-contracts/contracts/simplex/MetadataRenderer.sol` (new)
- `ens-contracts/contracts/simplex/SubnameRegistrar.sol` (new)
- `scripts/deploy-local.mjs`, `scripts/deploy-testnet.mjs`, `scripts/deploy-mainnet.mjs`
- `ens-contracts/deploy/**` (@rocketh; local/test only)

This file is the durable record of findings and **which risks have been
explicitly accepted**, so a later auditor knows what was a conscious decision
versus an oversight. Update it when the design or these decisions change.

## Findings summary

| ID | Severity | Status | Summary |
|----|----------|--------|---------|
| H1 | High (operational) | Accepted (runbook) | Deployer keeps `SimplexController` ownership (incl. UUPS upgrade) until the multisig calls `acceptOwnership()` |
| L1 | Low / informational | Accepted | `SubnameRegistrar` holds a registry-wide operator grant; safe only by immutability + the `_controller(parentNode)==msg.sender` gate |
| L2 | Low / informational | Accepted (by design) | Subnames are **soulbound to the 2LD NFT** (`ownerOf` derives from the token holder); not independently owned or transferable |
| L3 | Low | Accepted | `setMetadataRenderer` does no contract/ERC-165 check (fat-finger → recoverable metadata outage) |
| L4 | Low | **Fixed** | Label length now capped at 63 bytes at deploy (`setMaxLabelLength(63)`) |
| L5 | Low / informational | Accepted | `PublicResolver`'s `nameWrapper` slot is the `SubnameRegistrar` (subname auth via `ownerOf`); the 2LD itself is never wrapped |
| L6 | Low / informational | Accepted | `maxLabelLength` is freely settable up/down (owner-trusted policy knob) |
| L7 | Low / informational | Accepted (read-side) | Enumeration / `tokenURI` include expired-but-unburned names; readers must filter by `nameExpires` |
| L8 | Low / informational | Accepted | `UniversalResolver` deployed with a `DummyGatewayProvider` (CCIP-read unused) |
| L9 | Low / informational | Accepted (read-side) | A re-registered 2LD's old subname records keep resolving until `purge`d (generation invalidates ownership immediately; record cleanup is lazy) |

No critical or high vulnerability was found **in the contracts** themselves;
the single High is in the deploy/ownership handoff.

> A second, independent review on 2026-07-09 (run on Fable) confirmed this ledger
> and added findings **N1–N8** — see [the re-review](#2026-07-09--independent-re-review-fable).

## Fixed

### L4 — Unbounded label length → capped at 63 bytes
`registerWithLabel` stores the plaintext label in `labelOf` and the
`MetadataRenderer` builds JSON+SVG from it. With `maxLabelLength = 0` (no limit)
a registrant could store arbitrarily large labels (self-paid SSTORE) and inflate
the `tokenURI` render. No injection risk (the renderer's JSON/XML escaping is
fuzz-verified), but unbounded is undesirable. **Fix:** all deploy scripts now
call `baseRegistrar.setMaxLabelLength(63)` (the DNS octet limit) right after
`setMetadataRenderer`, while the deployer still owns the registrar. 63 bytes =
63 ASCII characters; fewer for multibyte labels (the cap is on `bytes(label).length`).
Subname labels are capped the same way: `SubnameRegistrar.MAX_LABEL_LENGTH = 63`
(a constant, since that contract has no general owner), enforced in `createSubname`.

## Accepted risks

### H1 — Two-step ownership handoff window (operational)
`SimplexController` is `Ownable2StepUpgradeable`. The deploy script calls
`transferOwnership(coldOwner)`, which only sets `pendingOwner`; the cold owner
must then call `acceptOwnership()`. Until it does, the **ephemeral deployer key**
still owns the controller — including `_authorizeUpgrade` (UUPS), `setPriceOracle`
(and, on `.simplex`, the price oracle's own `setPrices` / `setUsdOracle` /
`setPremium`, which have a second, separate `Ownable2Step` handover),
`disableNftGate`, `setMinCharLength`, `setDefaultResolver`, `registerReserved`,
`addReservedNames` / `removeReservedNames`, `setPublicSalesOpen` and `freeze()`.
(The registrar is 1-step `Ownable` and transfers immediately; only the controller
has this window. There is no reverse registrar — removed in names-v2.)

Two names-v2 changes narrow this window. `withdraw()` now pays `beneficiary`,
not `owner()`, and the beneficiary is set *before* the ownership transfer and can
afterwards only be changed by itself — so revenue is out of the deployer's reach
from the first block. And `setRegistrarAllowance` is beneficiary-only, so the
deployer cannot fund a registrar even while it still owns everything else.

**Accepted because** it is inherent to the ephemeral-deployer + 2-step pattern
and cannot be closed from the deploy script (only the cold owner can accept).
**Required operational mitigation (runbook):**
1. Immediately after deploy, the cold owner calls `SimplexController.acceptOwnership()`.
2. Verify `SimplexController.owner() == coldOwner` and `pendingOwner() == address(0)`.
3. Only then destroy/retire the deployer key. Treat it as fully privileged until step 2 passes.

### L1 — `SubnameRegistrar` registry-wide operator grant
Each user grants `ens.setApprovalForAll(subnameRegistrar, true)`, a
registry-wide operator permission over **all** their ENS nodes. This is safe
only because of two properties that an auditor must re-verify on any change:
1. The contract is **immutable** (no proxy, no general `owner`, no `delegatecall`,
   no `selfdestruct`) and its only operator-authorised registry write is
   `ens.setSubnodeRecord(parentNode, labelhash, address(this), resolver, 0)` in
   `createSubname` — i.e. it can only create a subnode **owned by itself** under
   a node the caller controls. (Its other registry writes, `setOwner`/`setResolver`
   in `_clear`, act only on nodes it already owns.)
2. `createSubname`/`deleteSubname` gate on `_controller(parentNode) == msg.sender`
   — the 2LD NFT holder (for a 2LD parent, the registry owner via auto-reclaim;
   for a subname parent, `ownerOf`). This is **load-bearing**: without it, since
   the contract is the grantor's operator, anyone could create subnames under
   another approver's node.

**Accepted** as the deliberate design (a minimal, single-purpose stand-in for the
NameWrapper). Users can revoke at any time with
`setApprovalForAll(subnameRegistrar, false)`. A `SubnameRegistrar` redeploy
requires users to re-approve the new address and re-create subnames.

**names-v2 extension.** `ENSRegistry.setApprovalForAllWithSig` makes this grant
obtainable by signature as well as by transaction, so a user with no ETH can make
it via a relayer. The state written is byte-for-byte what `setApprovalForAll`
writes, and the signed struct binds `owner`, `operator`, `approved`, a per-signer
nonce and a deadline, so a relayer cannot substitute the operator or replay. The
grant's *scope* is unchanged and still registry-wide, so the two properties above
remain load-bearing. What is new is the phishing surface: signing is cheaper to
solicit than transacting. Two mitigations, both required: the client must never
sign an approval it did not construct itself, and the UI must name the operator
and state the scope before signing. Revocation is also signable, so a mistaken
grant is undone without ETH.

### L2 — Subnames are soulbound to the 2LD NFT (by design)
A subname has no independent owner: in the registry it is owned by the
`SubnameRegistrar`, and its effective owner is whoever holds the parent 2LD token
(`ownerOf(node)` walks up the parent chain to the 2LD node, whose registry owner
tracks the NFT via BaseRegistrar **auto-reclaim** on transfer). Consequences,
all intended:
- Transferring the 2LD NFT moves every subname with it instantly — no reclaim,
  no re-seize, no stale ownership, and the previous owner loses all subname rights
  the moment the token leaves (including the ability to create new subnames,
  because the 2LD registry node also follows the NFT).
- Subnames are **not** independently sellable/transferable; integrators must not
  treat them as standalone assets.
- The verbatim `PublicResolver` authorises subname records against this `ownerOf`
  via its `nameWrapper` hook (see L5).
**Accepted by design.** See also L9 (re-registration cleanup is lazy).

### L3 — `setMetadataRenderer` has no contract check
Setting the renderer to an EOA or a non-conforming contract makes `tokenURI`
revert collection-wide until corrected (it low-level-calls the renderer and
ABI-decodes a `string`). **Accepted:** `onlyOwner` (multisig), not
attacker-reachable, and fully recoverable by setting a correct renderer. Deploy
scripts set a valid renderer; operators should spot-check `tokenURI(sampleId)`
after any future `setMetadataRenderer`.

### L5 — `PublicResolver`'s `nameWrapper` slot is the `SubnameRegistrar`
The verbatim `PublicResolver` is deployed with `nameWrapper = subnameRegistrar`
(not `address(0)`). Its `isAuthorised(node)` does `if (ens.owner(node) ==
nameWrapper) owner = nameWrapper.ownerOf(node)` — so for a subname node (owned by
the registrar) the resolver authorises records against the live 2LD holder
(`subnameRegistrar.ownerOf`), while a **2LD** node (owned directly by the NFT
holder via auto-reclaim) never takes that branch and authorises directly. So the
2LD is **not** wrapped; only subname auth routes through the registrar. The
registrar implements just the one function the resolver calls (`ownerOf(uint256)`);
no other `INameWrapper` method is invoked on this path. We do not modify the
verbatim resolver — only the constructor argument. **Accepted.**

### L6 — `maxLabelLength` not monotonic
Unlike the controller's `minCharLength` (monotonic decrease), the registrar's
`maxLabelLength` is freely settable up/down by the owner. An owner could set it
to a tiny value and block new registrations. **Accepted:** owner is the
multisig (trusted); it's a policy knob, not an attacker surface.

### L7 — Enumeration includes expired names
`ERC721Enumerable` (`totalSupply` / `tokenOfOwnerByIndex` / `balanceOf`) and
`tokenURI` reflect raw token ownership, which is only updated on
transfer/mint/burn — **not** on expiry (a name is burned only on re-registration
after its grace period). So they can disagree with the grace-period `ownerOf`.
**Accepted (read-side contract):** all readers (the dApp, resolvers, integrators)
MUST filter by `nameExpires(id) > block.timestamp`. Documented as an invariant
on `BaseRegistrarImplementation`.

### L8 — `DummyGatewayProvider` on the `UniversalResolver`
The `UniversalResolver` is deployed with a dummy CCIP-read gateway provider.
SNRC resolves on-chain (text records), so no off-chain gateway is relied upon.
**Accepted** as long as no CCIP-read path is introduced; revisit if off-chain
resolution is ever added.

### L9 — Re-registered 2LD's old subname records resolve until purged
When a 2LD expires and is re-registered, BaseRegistrar calls
`subnameRegistrar.onReregister(node)`, which bumps a per-2LD `generation`. This
invalidates the previous owner's subnames **immediately** at the ownership level:
`ownerOf` returns `address(0)` for them, so no one can modify them and the dApp
won't list them. But their **stored resolver records keep resolving** until the
registry/resolver storage is cleared — you cannot atomically delete an unbounded
number of subnames inside the re-registration tx. Cleanup is therefore a
permissionless, batched `purge(parentNode, labelhashes[])` (storage-refund
incentivised). **Accepted (read-side):** this matches plain ENS (an expired
name's subnames also linger until cleared); the dApp should `purge` on 2LD
acquisition. The leak is records-only — ownership/authorisation never transfers
to the new owner without an explicit `createSubname`.

## Assurances (verified properties)

- **No reentrancy surface** in the new contracts: the registry is trusted, the
  renderer is `view`, no ETH is handled, and the controller's record-write path
  is `nonReentrant` (covered by the `ReentrantResolver` test).
- **`labelOf` cannot be spoofed** (registrar or subname): the key is
  `keccak256(label)` and the value is `label`, so the stored entry is always the
  correct preimage; write-once only avoids redundant writes.
- **`registerWithLabel` is the only registration path** — every registration
  records its label; the raw-labelhash `register(uint256)` was removed.
- **Deploy ordering is sound:** reserved names are set and the TLD node is handed
  to the registrar before registration is possible; `setMetadataRenderer` /
  `setMaxLabelLength` run before the ownership handoff; the 60s commit-reveal
  blocks same-transaction front-running.
- **MetadataRenderer escaping is fuzz-verified** — no JSON or SVG injection from
  adversarial labels (`test/simplex/FuzzMetadataRenderer.test.ts`).
- Removing NameWrapper eliminated the prior renew-desync issue and the
  wrapper-aware-resolver authorization complexity.

## 2026-07-09 — independent re-review (Fable)

A fresh review of the same scope, run independently on the Fable model and
cross-checked against live mainnet state. It **confirms every ledger finding
above** (H1, L1–L9) and adds the items below. **Owner note:** the live cold owner
is the `simplexchat.eth` **EOA** (`0xDa06…0340`), not a multisig — read "multisig"
above as "the cold owner."

### Ledger status change

- **H1 — exposure elevated, still open.** 16 days after the `.testing` deploy
  (2026-06-23) the cold owner still has not called `acceptOwnership()`, so the
  ephemeral deployer EOA (`0xD83B…fBC9`) remains the controller owner — and the
  key is demonstrably **hot**: on 2026-07-09 it sent `disableNftGate()` then a
  `commit`/`register`. The blast radius is wider than first stated: the verbatim
  `PublicResolver` trusts `trustedETHController` (the proxy) for **every** node,
  so UUPS-upgrade authority ⇒ the ability to rewrite any name's
  `simplex.contact`/`simplex.channel` records (a routing hijack across all
  `.testing` names), plus arbitrary register/renew, an oracle swap, and a one-step
  `renounceOwnership()` brick. `trustedETHController` is immutable in the resolver,
  so recovery from a malicious upgrade would mean redeploying the resolver and
  migrating every name. **Action: complete the ownership handoff now; treat the
  deployer key as fully privileged until then.**

### New findings

| ID | Severity | Summary |
|----|----------|---------|
| N1 | Medium (operational) | NFT gate now disabled + zero pricing ⇒ open, free `.testing` registration |
| N2 | Low | A revived subname inherits the previous owner's resolver records |
| N3 | Low | Deleting a middle subname strands its descendants (records keep resolving) |
| N4 | Low / info — **FIXED** | Reverse-record registrations always revert on mainnet (reverse registrars are `address(0)`) |
| N5 | Low / info | Unrestricted on-chain charset ⇒ display spoofing (homoglyph/bidi), not injection |
| N6 | Info | `purge`/`delete` linear-scan children — quadratic on large sets; purge front-first |
| N7 | Info — **partly FIXED** | `withdraw()` pays `owner()` (the deployer during the H1 window); `renounceOwnership` not disabled |
| N8 | Info | Documentation drift (some fixed with this review) |

- **N1** — `nftGateEnabled()` is now `false` (disabled on-chain 2026-07-09,
  one-way) and the `.testing` price array is all zeros, so anyone can mass-register
  6+-char `.testing` names for gas only (the reserved list covers only `simplex`,
  `simplex-chat`). If unintended, recourse is `setPriceOracle` (still unfrozen) or
  a UUPS upgrade. Confirm intent.
- **N2** — `createSubname` revives a generation-dead node but leaves the old
  owner's `PublicResolver` records intact (`purge`/`_clear` zero the registry
  resolver pointer, not resolver storage). Mitigation: the dApp should
  `clearRecords(node)` alongside `createSubname`, and on 2LD acquisition.
- **N3** — `deleteSubname` on a middle node zeroes it but leaves descendants with
  a dangling `parentOf`; their records keep resolving and `purge` skips them while
  their generation still matches. Mitigation: delete leaf-first in the dApp, or
  accept as self-inflicted within a single owner.
- **N4 — FIXED (names-v2).** `register()` used to call the reverse registrars when
  the reverse bits were set, but both are `address(0)` on mainnet, so such a call
  reverted after the 60 s commit was already spent. The recommended mitigation
  (early-revert) is implemented, and then some: reverse resolution is removed from
  the deployment altogether. `makeCommitment` rejects any non-zero `reverseRecord`
  with `ReverseRecordNotSupported`, so the commit is never spent; the two registrars
  are no longer deployed; and `PublicResolver` no longer inherits `ReverseClaimer`,
  which was the last thing forcing one to exist. A related defect found on the way:
  the branch passed `msg.sender` as the reverse subject, so a *sponsored*
  registration would have named the registrar's hot wallet rather than the buyer.
- **N5** — only min length (≥ 6 codepoints) and max bytes (≤ 63) are enforced;
  labels may contain homoglyph/bidi/zero-width characters. The renderer escaping
  blocks JSON/SVG injection, but lookalike names can be minted for
  marketplace/social spoofing. ENSIP-15-normalising clients won't resolve them.
  Accept (matches ENS's on-chain posture) or enforce an LDH charset in `valid()`.
- **N6** — `_removeChild` linear-scans `_children`; deleting/purging a large dead
  set naively is O(n·m). A front-of-array-first purge is O(1) per item.
  Self-inflicted; document the ordering.
- **N7 — partly FIXED (names-v2).** `withdraw()` no longer pays `owner()`: it pays
  `beneficiary`, a role set once by the owner while unset and thereafter only by
  itself, so the deploy key never controls revenue and the H1 window does not
  cover it. Still open: the inherited one-step `renounceOwnership` is not
  disabled, and an owner slip would permanently orphan admin and upgrades. That
  now matters *more*, not less — the plan deliberately keeps the owner alive
  forever so brand reservation can continue, so there is no point at which
  renouncing is the intended move. Consider overriding it to revert.
- **N8 — FIXED.** The two items this left open outside `docs/` are now corrected:
  `CLAUDE.md`'s claim about keeping upstream `register(uint256,…)`, and
  `ens-contracts/docs/upgrades.md`'s stale `__gap[49]`. `upgrades.md` now
  documents the real layout (`__gap[45]`, the names-v2 block, and the reserved
  placeholder slots) and the fact that `freeze()` ends upgradeability entirely.

**Verdict:** no new critical/high in the contracts themselves. The dominant risk
remains operational — the ownership handoff is still open with a hot deployer key
whose upgrade authority transitively controls every name's resolver records, and
that same key one-way-disabled the NFT gate (with zero pricing ⇒ open, free
registration).

---

## names-v2 — new surface and adversarial review

names-v2 adds sponsored registration (a registrar spends a money allowance, the
user never holds ETH), one-shot EIP-712 intents relayed on the user's behalf, a
two-key governance split, and a one-way `freeze()`. It removes reverse
resolution and, in an earlier revision, an on-chain edit-credit system.

### New privileged surface

| Function | Who | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `setRegistrarAllowance(registrar, attoUSD)` | beneficiary only | Replaces, not adds. Zeroing it is the kill switch for a compromised registrar and must take one transaction. |
| `setBeneficiary(address)` | owner while unset, beneficiary thereafter | Set before the ownership handover, so revenue is independent of the deploy key from the first block. |
| `setPublicSalesOpen(bool)` | owner **or** beneficiary | Restrictive direction on the fast key: an exploit in the payable path accrues harm per block. Dies at `freeze()`. |
| `addReservedNames(string[])` | owner **or** beneficiary | Also fast, and for a sharper reason: a scheduled reservation would tell a squatter which name is valuable and how long it stays unprotected. |
| `removeReservedNames`, `registerReserved`, `setDefaultResolver`, `setMinCharLength`, `setPriceOracle` | owner only | Permissive directions stay behind the timelock. |
| `freeze()` | owner only | One-way. Makes the implementation permanent and seals `setPublicSalesOpen`. Refuses while sales are closed, so a mis-ordered freeze cannot shut the payable path forever. |
| `registerWithCredit`, `renewWithCredit` | any address with allowance | Deducts the name's own list price in attoUSD. No value attached. |
| `transferWithSig`, `setTextWithSig`, `clearRecordsWithSig`, `setApprovalForAllWithSig`, `createSubnameWithSig`, `deleteSubnameWithSig` | anyone holding the owner's signature | The relayer pays gas and chooses nothing else. Each contract keeps its own per-signer nonce. |

### What `freeze()` does not stop

`freeze()` fixes the implementation and seals the sales switch. It does **not**
end issuance, and the plan should not be read as saying it does:

- the guardian can still fund a registrar (`setRegistrarAllowance`) and that
  registrar can still mint names through `registerWithCredit`;
- the owner can still `addReservedNames` and `registerReserved`.

That is deliberate — brand reservation and outreach have to continue for the
life of the namespace, which is why the owner is never renounced. The guarantee
a freeze gives is narrower and worth stating exactly: **no key can change the
code, and no key can take a name that someone already holds.** Names that are
unregistered remain issuable by the two governance keys forever.

### Bounds that are the registrar's job, not the contract's

`SubnameRegistrar` supports arbitrary depth, and `ownerOf` walks the parent chain
on every authorisation, so a subname nested D levels deep costs O(D) per read and
a subtree built to depth D costs O(D²) to create. Nothing on-chain caps D.

This is left off-chain on purpose. The relayer is the only sponsored caller: it
sees the full call before it pays for it, so it can refuse an abusive depth for
free, whereas a constant compiled into an immutable contract is a guess at a
limit that can never be revised. A user paying their own gas is only ever
grieving themselves. **Relayer operators must enforce a depth limit** (5 is
ample for the SimpleX UX) along with the payload and gas bounds they already
apply.

### Shadow subnames, and what a buyer must check

A 2LD's holder owns its registry node, so they can call
`ENSRegistry.setSubnodeOwner` directly and create a subname the
`SubnameRegistrar` never sees. Such a node is not soulbound, is not indexed, and
has no generation, so **selling the 2LD does not move it**: after the sale
`pay.alice.simplex` can still be owned — and still resolve — to the seller,
while `alice.simplex` belongs to the buyer.

This cannot be prevented on-chain. Registry authority over a subnode belongs to
the parent's owner by construction, and the registrar's soulbinding works only
because the registrar happens to own the nodes it created; a 2LD owner can pull
even a *tracked* subname back out the same way.

What makes it a disclosure problem rather than a theft one is that it is always
recoverable: `setSubnodeOwner` is authorised against the **parent**, so the new
holder can overwrite any subnode under their name unilaterally, and the previous
owner is then locked out. Both directions are pinned in
`TestShadowSubnames.test.ts`.

So the requirement lands on the buyer, and on whatever surfaces a name for sale:

- **Before buying, enumerate the name's subnodes** — the registrar's index shows
  only the ones it created, so completeness needs `NewOwner` logs on the registry
  filtered by the 2LD node, not `getChildren`.
- **After buying, overwrite anything unexpected.** One `setSubnodeOwner` per
  label; no cooperation from the seller is needed.
- A subname's records survive the overwrite, so re-point or clear them too.

### Client and relayer version coupling

`TRANSFER_TYPEHASH` gained `ephemeralPubKey` and `viewTag`, and the transfer
announcement is now ERC-5564's `Announcement` rather than a bespoke event. Both
are consensus between the contract and everything that signs for or watches it,
and `BaseRegistrarImplementation` is **not** upgradeable — so the two shapes
cannot coexist in one deployment and cannot be migrated after the fact.

- Signers, relayers and scanners must ship in lockstep with the deployment they
  talk to.
- The live `.testing` registrar keeps the **old** typehash and the old event
  permanently. A client must key both off the deployment it is addressing, not
  off its own build. `.testing` is not being upgraded, so this is a fork in the
  client, not a migration.

### Deployment opsec

The deploy runner is as much a part of the security boundary as the contracts,
because a mis-run is unrecoverable in the same way a bad constructor argument is.
What it now refuses to do:

- **Run against the wrong chain.** `chainId` is asserted to be 1 before any
  spend, so an `MAINNET_RPC_URL` pointing at a testnet stops the run instead of
  deploying a full stack to the wrong place and journalling it as a success.
- **Accept a mistyped address.** Every address input is EIP-55 checked, which is
  the only automatic protection against a transposed character in the variable
  that ends up owning the namespace.
- **Deploy against a dead price feed.** `latestAnswer()` is probed up front; a
  feed returning zero or negative makes every quote revert and the payable path
  unusable from the first block.
- **Deploy stale bytecode.** The run compiles before it starts. Freshness is not
  inferred from timestamps — Hardhat caches on content, so an mtime heuristic
  both misses real staleness and blocks on touched-but-unchanged files. This is
  also the check that would have caught the branch that did not compile.
- **Pay without limit.** The stall bump compounds 20% per stalled interval and
  had no ceiling; it now stops at `ABSOLUTE_MAX_BASE_FEE_GWEI` (4× the configured
  cap by default) rather than paying whatever a congested week demands.
- **Build on a block that might not survive.** Each step waits three
  confirmations before the next one depends on it, and a receipt that a reorg
  removes returns the step to waiting rather than being journalled.
- **Overwrite the record of a live deployment.** An addresses file with no
  journal beside it aborts the run.
- **Leak the provider key.** The fork URL reaches the child process through the
  environment; `--fork <url>` put it in argv, where any local user could read it
  from `ps`.

And what it now proves rather than assumes: a **post-deploy read-back** checks
the TLD node's owner, the controller's registration, `maxLabelLength`, the
subname hook, the metadata renderer, the default resolver, the beneficiary, the
NFT gate, `minCharLength`, the freeze and sales flags, the subname registrar's
resolver, and that a six-character name quotes a non-zero price. A journal proves
each transaction was mined; only the read-back proves the stack is wired the way
the script intended. It runs while the deploy key still owns everything, and the
run then prints the `acceptOwnership()` calls the admin must make — until those
land, `Ownable2Step` leaves the deploy key in control and it must be treated as
hot.

### The invariant everything rests on

`BaseRegistrarImplementation._register` opens with `require(available(id))`, and
`available(id)` is `expiries[id] + GRACE_PERIOD < block.timestamp`. That check is
in the **immutable** registrar, so no owner power on any contract — including an
arbitrary controller upgrade before the freeze — can seize, transfer or re-point
a name someone holds. `reclaim` requires `_isApprovedOrOwner`; `transferWithSig`
requires the owner's signature and a grace-aware `ownerOf`.

### Adversarial review (three expert personas + independent refutation)

No critical, high or medium finding survived. Fixed as a result: a permissionless
edit-credit faucet and an overflow that could brick renewals (both removed with
the credit system itself); `freeze()`'s missing `publicSalesOpen` guard;
`StablePriceOracle`'s unchecked `latestAnswer()` cast; the sponsored path's
needless dependency on the ETH/USD feed; and the reverse-record subject bug.

A second round against the branch found, and this revision fixes, four issues
that all shared one root — **state that outlives the registration it belongs
to**:

- **Stale records on re-registration.** A name that lapsed kept its previous
  owner's text records, so a squatter's SimpleX address resolved under the new
  owner's name. `_registerCore` and `registerReserved` now retire records on the
  default resolver before writing anything new.
- **Revived subnames.** The same leak one level down: re-creating a label left
  behind by a previous 2LD owner resurfaced their records. Creating over a
  generation-dead subname is now refused outright — `purge` first — and both
  `purge` and `deleteSubname` retire the records they drop.
- **Expired 2LDs kept their subtree.** Registry ownership of a 2LD survives
  expiry, so its former holder retained subname authority indefinitely. The
  registrar now mirrors each registration's expiry (`onExpiryChanged`) and gates
  authority on it.
- **Unauthenticated announcement fields.** `ephemeralPubKey` and `viewTag` sat
  outside the signed struct, so a relayer could fabricate a stealth derivation on
  a genuine transfer. They are now part of `TRANSFER_TYPEHASH`, and the event
  itself is ERC-5564's `Announcement` verbatim rather than a bespoke one.

A third pass over those fixes found two more, both fixed here:

- **Record retirement was scoped to the *current* default resolver**, so the
  first `setDefaultResolver` rotation would have silently stopped retiring
  records for every name still pointing at the old one — reopening the leak
  without any code changing. The controller now remembers every resolver it has
  ever made the default (`wasDefaultResolver`) and retires against that set. The
  set is deliberately not "any resolver": each entry is one we deployed and that
  trusts the controller, so the call can neither revert nor burn the
  registrant's gas on a hostile resolver.
- **The deploy runner treated inclusion as success.** A transaction that reverted
  at inclusion still produced a receipt, and the step was journalled as done and
  skipped on every later resume. `recordSuccess` now refuses a non-success
  receipt and stops the run.

Accepted, and new to this ledger:

- **V1 — a compromised guardian is unrecoverable after the freeze.** Only the
  beneficiary may rotate itself, and the post-freeze upgrade escape is closed, so
  a compromised guardian permanently holds `withdraw` and `setRegistrarAllowance`.
  Names are untouched. Accepted on the basis that the guardian is a Safe:
  compromise requires the multisig threshold, and the alternative — letting the
  slow owner replace the beneficiary — would put the treasury back under the key
  the split exists to keep it away from.
- **V2 — relayed gas is bounded off-chain, not on-chain.** Several sponsored
  entry points take unbounded arguments, and OZ `SignatureChecker` falls through
  to an ERC-1271 `staticcall` when recovery fails. A contract-level cap would be
  a guess at a future limit baked into a contract that is immutable or frozen at
  lockdown. The relayer is the only caller of these paths and the only party that
  can judge abuse, so it must pre-flight simulate every relayed transaction and
  refuse above a gas threshold, and validate payload sizes before submitting.
  This is a security property carried by the service, not the contracts.
- **V3 — hostile pricing is the one path from a retained key to a held name.**
  `setPriceOracle` survives the freeze by necessity: the Chainlink feed is
  `immutable` inside the oracle, so freezing pricing would let a retired feed end
  registration and renewal forever. The cost is that an admin could price
  renewals out of reach and take names as they lapse. It is the slowest and
  loudest attack available — public for the timelock delay, then each name's
  remaining term plus 90 days of grace, with renewal permissionless throughout.

### Closed, not a finding

*Reserving is front-run-proof.* `addReservedNames` is a single atomic call with
no commit/reveal, while both registration paths must present a commitment already
aged `minCommitmentAge` (60 s in the deployment). An attacker who first learns a
name from the guardian's pending transaction cannot register it — the reservation
mines in the next block, long before their commitment matures. A pre-aged
speculative commitment does not help either, since the reserved check runs at
registration time. Pinned by `test/simplex/TestReservationRace.test.ts`.
