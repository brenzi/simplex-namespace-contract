# CLAUDE.md — SimpleX Namespace Registry Contract (SNRC)

Implementation plan: [`snrc-implementation-plan.md`](./snrc-implementation-plan.md).

## BINDING: Minimize diff to upstream

This project forks ENS contracts and ENS app v3. The #1 priority is **minimal diff to upstream** for auditability. Every changed line must be justified.

Rules:
- **Do NOT rename files** unless the contract's interface/behavior actually changes. `ENSRegistry.sol` stays `ENSRegistry.sol`.
- **Do NOT restyle the frontend.** Keep ENS's Thorin design system, colors, fonts, layout. Only swap logo/favicon.
- **Do NOT refactor, reformat, or "clean up"** ENS code. Match their style even if you'd do it differently.
- **Do NOT add comments** explaining what you changed or why — that belongs in commit messages and the plan, not in the diff.
- **Do NOT add abstractions** "for flexibility" — if a one-line change works, don't wrap it in a helper.
- **Disable features by short-circuiting** (early return, skip rendering), not by deleting ENS code.
- **UUPS wrapping is mechanical**: constructor→initialize, add UUPSUpgradeable inheritance, add _authorizeUpgrade. No other changes to the contract body.
- **Do NOT rename variables, functions, or files** unless the name is actively misleading after our changes.
- **Do NOT move code** between files unless scope genuinely needs to change.
- Anything not strictly required by our functional changes is **completely prohibited** — no drive-by refactoring, no "making code better."
- When in doubt, leave ENS code untouched. A smaller diff is always better.

## What this is

GitHub forks of [ENS contracts](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts) + [ENS app v3](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-app-v3) adapted for SimpleX Chat's decentralized namespace system. Maps human-readable names (`alice.simplex`) to categorized SimpleX short link data (contact links, channel links) on Ethereum.

## Repo structure

Public forks as git submodules of this repo:

```
simplex-namespace-contract/           ← this repo (parent)
  ens-contracts/                      ← submodule → simplex-network/ens-contracts
  ens-app-v3/                         ← submodule → simplex-network/ens-app-v3
  scripts/                            ← cross-repo deployment helpers
  docs/                               ← project-level docs
  test/                               ← cross-repo test fixtures
```

- `main` in each fork tracks upstream ENS (fetch-only)
- `simplex` branch is our working branch — all SNRC changes here
- `main...simplex` diff on GitHub is the audit surface
- This parent repo holds the plan, docs, and cross-repo tooling

## Architecture

Two separate deployments — one per TLD. Each is a near-standard ENS deployment with a custom controller. `.testing` launches first.

- `.testing` — NFT-gated (SMPXNFT holders only initially), 6+ char minimum, reserved names
- `.simplex` — NO NFT gate, 6+ char minimum, reserved names

Each deployment: `ENSRegistry` + `BaseRegistrarImplementation` + `SimplexController` + `SimplexResolver` + `MetadataRenderer` + `SubnameRegistrar` + `Root`. ENS contracts are used verbatim except: `SimplexController` (custom, UUPS), `BaseRegistrarImplementation` (modified — ERC721Enumerable + on-chain label index + `tokenURI` + `transferWithSig`), `ENSRegistry` (adds `setApprovalForAllWithSig`), `PublicResolver` (no longer inherits `ReverseClaimer`), `StablePriceOracle` (adds `priceUSD` + a sixth length bucket), plus the new SNRC contracts `MetadataRenderer`, `SubnameRegistrar` and `SimplexResolver`. **No NameWrapper** and **no reverse registrar** (both removed — see Deviations).

`SimplexController` is UUPS-upgradeable (ERC-1967 proxy). Every upgrade must preserve its storage layout — see [`ens-contracts/docs/upgrades.md`](./ens-contracts/docs/upgrades.md) for the `__gap` / append-only invariants and the pre-upgrade checklist.

Resolver: `SimplexResolver` — `PublicResolver` plus signed record writes (`setTextWithSig`, `clearRecordsWithSig`). SimpleX links stored as text records: `simplex.contact`, `simplex.channel`.

Subnames are on-chain via the `SubnameRegistrar`: registry subnodes **owned by the registrar and soulbound to the 2LD NFT** — a subname's effective owner is the current 2LD token holder, derived via `SubnameRegistrar.ownerOf` (which walks up the parent chain to the 2LD node), so transferring the NFT moves all its subnames instantly. Record authorisation routes through the verbatim `PublicResolver`'s `nameWrapper` hook (deployed with `nameWrapper = subnameRegistrar`); the 2LD node itself is owned directly by the NFT holder because `BaseRegistrar` **auto-reclaims** it to the new holder on transfer. On re-registration, `BaseRegistrar` calls `subnameRegistrar.onReregister` to bump a per-2LD generation that invalidates the previous owner's subnames (garbage-collected via permissionless `purge`). Subnames are created + indexed on-chain so they enumerate without an indexer; depth (subnames of subnames) is supported in the contracts. 2LDs themselves are plain ERC-721 tokens on the `BaseRegistrar` and trade directly on any marketplace; their NFT metadata (JSON + SVG, with the domain name) is rendered fully on-chain by the `MetadataRenderer`. There is no NameWrapper and no ERC-1155 wrapping.

Payment is ETH (same as ENS). Pricing: $1/year (6+ chars), $8 (5), $32 (4), $128 (3). ENS price oracle verbatim.

## NFT gate contract (mainnet)

Address: `0x3AF6D9Ee862376A8DFC0a78847Eb20A153557291`
Name: "SimpleX NFT: SMPX testnet access", Symbol: SMPXNFT, ERC-721, 560 tokens.
Key non-standard functions: `setMinter(address)`, `setNextTokenURI(string)`, `lockMintingPermanently()`, `burn(uint256)`, `withdraw()`. Sequential token IDs via `nextTokenId` counter. Gate check is `balanceOf(sender) > 0`.
`MockSMPXNFT.sol` replicates this interface for local/testnet.

## SimpleX data in resolver

`SimplexResolver` — `PublicResolver` plus a sponsored path (see names-v2 below).
SimpleX links stored as text records:
- `simplex.contact` — contact short link (1:1 messaging)
- `simplex.channel` — channel short link (group/channel)

Both records store a **comma-separated list** of URLs (primary first, fallbacks after) so a name can advertise multiple SMP servers for redundancy. Clients SHOULD try them in order. The on-chain layer is unchanged — it's still a plain `setText` / `text` against the ENSIP-5 key. The SNRC REST resolver (`scripts/resolver/snrc-resolve.py`) parses the CSV and returns each as `string[]` (`simplexContact`, `simplexChannel`). The dApp's editor caps the list at 5 entries.

## names-v2

A user buys a name through the app store and never holds ETH; SimpleX relays every on-chain action. See [`docs/plans/names-v2-contracts.md`](./docs/plans/names-v2-contracts.md).

- **Registrar allowance.** The guardian grants a registrar hot wallet a spending limit in **attoUSD**; `registerWithCredit` / `renewWithCredit` deduct the name's own list price and attach no value. Replaces rather than adds, so zeroing it is a one-transaction kill switch. `StablePriceOracle` gained `priceUSD()` (`IPriceOracleUSD`) so the limit is denominated in the unit the price list is configured in and does not drift with ETH.
- **Signed intents.** One-shot EIP-712 signatures relayed by anyone: `transferWithSig` (BaseRegistrar, with the ERC-5564 `StealthNameTransfer` announcement), `setTextWithSig` / `clearRecordsWithSig` (SimplexResolver), `setApprovalForAllWithSig` (ENSRegistry — the one call that otherwise forces a user to hold ETH), `createSubnameWithSig` / `deleteSubnameWithSig` (SubnameRegistrar). Each contract keeps its own per-signer nonce.
- **Metering is off-chain.** The relayer is the only caller of the sponsored write paths, so an on-chain budget could only reject a transaction it had already agreed to pay for. It bounds payload size and gas itself; the contracts carry the signature and the nonce.
- **No reverse resolution.** `ReverseRegistrar` / `DefaultReverseRegistrar` are not deployed, `PublicResolver` no longer inherits `ReverseClaimer`, and a non-zero `reverseRecord` reverts `ReverseRecordNotSupported`. The controller's two slots are reserved, not deleted.

## Admin capabilities

Two keys. **Admin** (a timelock behind a multisig) holds the rare and permissive powers; **guardian** (a multisig, no delay) holds the restrictive and urgent ones. The rule: a power is on the fast key only when the harm it answers accrues faster than the timelock delay.

- `disableNftGate()` — one-way (true→false) — *admin*
- `setMinCharLength(uint8)` — monotonic decrease only (6→5→4→3) — *admin*
- `removeReservedNames` / `registerReserved` / `setDefaultResolver` / `setPriceOracle` / `recoverFunds` — *admin*
- `addReservedNames` — *admin **or** guardian*: a scheduled reservation would tell a squatter which name is valuable and for how long
- `setPublicSalesOpen(bool)` — *admin **or** guardian*: gates the payable path only; the credited, reserved and renew paths are exempt
- `setRegistrarAllowance` / `setBeneficiary` — **guardian only**; `withdraw()` is permissionless and pays `beneficiary` (there is no `setTreasury`)
- `freeze()` — *admin*, one-way: fixes the implementation and seals the sales switch. Refuses while sales are closed
- UUPS upgrade authority — *admin*, until `freeze()`. The owner is **not** renounced: brand reservation must continue indefinitely

## Deviations from `snrc-implementation-plan.md`

- **NameWrapper removed entirely (wrapper-free v3).** The wrapper was the largest source of complexity/defects (`.eth`-hardcoding, renew-desync, wrapper-aware-resolver auth) for features SNRC doesn't need (ERC-1155 wrapping, fuses/emancipation for trustless subname markets). It is deleted from the source tree. Replacements: 2LDs trade as plain ERC-721; **`BaseRegistrarImplementation` (v3, modified)** adds `ERC721Enumerable` (trustless "My Names"), a write-once `labelOf` label index (`registerWithLabel(string,…)`), an owner-settable `maxLabelLength` guard, and `tokenURI` delegating to a swappable `metadataRenderer`; **`MetadataRenderer`** (SNRC, swappable via `setMetadataRenderer`) renders JSON + SVG fully on-chain; **`SubnameRegistrar`** (SNRC, immutable) creates + indexes subnames. Only the `wrapper/INameWrapper.sol` interface is kept, because the verbatim `PublicResolver` imports it (deployed with `nameWrapper = address(0)`). The earlier `simplex-mainnet-testing-v2` wrapper deployment (`0x0994819e…e9ef`) is historical; v3 is a fresh redeploy.
- **`BaseRegistrarImplementation` is no longer verbatim.** `registerWithLabel` is the only registration path (the raw-labelhash `register` is gone), so every registration records its label; it also adds `labelOf` / `tokenURI` / `setMetadataRenderer` / `setMaxLabelLength` / ERC721Enumerable, and in names-v2 `transferWithSig` + `StealthNameTransfer`. Only `SimplexController` is wrapped in a proxy; the registrar is immutable.
- **`ENSRegistry` is no longer verbatim.** names-v2 adds `setApprovalForAllWithSig`. It is the root of trust, so the diff is deliberately additive: the same `_operatorApprovals` write and `ApprovalForAll` event the existing setter produces, reached by signature instead of by transaction.
- **`PublicResolver` no longer inherits `ReverseClaimer`.** Its constructor called `claim` on whatever owns `addr.reverse`, which is a hard dependency on a deployed reverse registrar. It cannot be short-circuited from a subclass, so the inheritance is dropped — three lines, all deletions, of a feature this deployment does not use.

## Toolchain

- Node 22.x, pnpm 9.x
- Solidity 0.8.26, Hardhat 3.x (ENS upstream uses this)
- OpenZeppelin Contracts 4.9.x (ERC-721 + ERC721Enumerable, Base64, Ownable) + contracts-upgradeable (UUPS, Ownable2Step) for `SimplexController`
- Frontend: Next.js + styled-components + wagmi/viem (fork of ens-app-v3, logo swap only)
- Tests: Hardhat + ethers v6 (contracts), Playwright (e2e)

## Deployment targets

- **Local**: Hardhat node, MockSMPXNFT + DummyOracle (fixed ETH/USD rate)
- **Sepolia testnet**: chainId 11155111, MockSMPXNFT deployed once + Chainlink ETH/USD feed (`0x694AA17…`)
- **Mainnet**: Chainlink ETH/USD oracle, real SMPXNFT (`0x3AF6D9Ee...`), treasury = SNCC multisig

### tracking of deployed versions

Maintain the rule that each onchain deployment shall tag the git commit it deploys for later reference. Existing tags:
* https://github.com/simplex-network/ens-contracts/releases/tag/simplex-sepolia-testing-v1
* https://github.com/simplex-network/ens-contracts/releases/tag/simplex-mainnet-testing-v1
* https://github.com/simplex-network/ens-contracts/releases/tag/simplex-mainnet-testing-v2 (NameWrapper TLD-parameterisation — needs tagging on the redeploy commit)

## Deployment order (per TLD)

Each TLD is an independent deployment. Only `SimplexController` is behind a proxy
(ERC1967/UUPS); every other contract is non-upgradeable:

1. MockSMPXNFT (local/testnet only, shared)
2. ENSRegistry
3. Root → transfer registry root → assign TLD ownership → lock
4. BaseRegistrarImplementation v3 (own the TLD node)
5. Price oracle (DummyOracle local / Chainlink mainnet) + ExponentialPremiumPriceOracle
6. SimplexController = impl + ERC1967 proxy (NFT gate on for .testing, off for .simplex); add as controller on the base registrar
7. SubnameRegistrar(registry, baseRegistrar)
8. SimplexResolver (`nameWrapper = SubnameRegistrar`, `trustedETHController = controller`, `trustedReverseRegistrar = address(0)`) → `subnameRegistrar.setResolver(resolver)` → `controller.setDefaultResolver(resolver)`
9. MetadataRenderer(`.<tld>`) → `baseRegistrar.setMetadataRenderer(renderer)`
10. UniversalResolver + Multicall3
11. `baseRegistrar.setMaxLabelLength(63)` — not optional: the label is written to `labelOf` permanently
12. Reserve the a-priori names, then hand over: `setBeneficiary(guardian)` **first** (owner-callable only while unset), then ownership of Root, BaseRegistrar and the controller to the admin timelock
13. Output addresses to `deployments/<network>-<tld>.json`

No reverse registrar is deployed. `Root.lock` is **not** called at deployment — while the label is unlocked a redeploy can keep the registry and re-point the TLD, which is the cheap recovery path until real users exist.

## Conventions from the PoC to follow

- Use `hardhat.config.ts` (not `.cjs`), but match PoC's solc settings
- ethers v6 footguns: `NonceManager` doesn't auto-increment across calls; `signer.reset()` after expected reverts; use `await signer.getAddress()` not `signer.address`

## Frontend approach

Fork ens-app-v3, minimal diff. Each frontend deployment targets one TLD via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SIMPLEX_TLD` env var.

### Done
- **ensjs patch**: `getNameType` + `validation` patched so `.testing`/`.simplex` are treated as eth-like TLDs (pnpm patch, 4 one-line changes)
- **TLD support**: all `.endsWith('.eth')` checks expanded to include our TLDs
- **Search**: bare name search appends configured TLD
- **Branding**: placeholder logo SVGs (need real SimpleX logo)
- **Disable**: DNS import, ENS v2, legacy favourites, ENS nav links — short-circuited
- **Images**: avatar upload hidden, avatar display disabled (useEnsAvatar returns null)
- **Chains**: Sepolia testnet wired (Hoodi was rejected — Sepolia gives us Chainlink ETH/USD and a public subgraph)
- **Config**: `.env.simplex` with all env vars, contract addresses via `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_ADDRESSES`
- **Build**: `pnpm build` passes

### Remaining
- **Admin panel**: new page for reserved names, char length, NFT gate management
- **NFT gate indicator**: show NFT requirement on .testing registration
- **Pricing display**: show $1/$8/$32/$128 instead of ENS pricing
- **Real logo**: replace placeholder SVGs with SimpleX brand assets
- **End-to-end test**: deploy contracts to Hardhat, point frontend, verify full registration flow
- **Subgraph**: ENS app relies on The Graph for name queries — local dev without subgraph limits some features

## Gotchas / time-sinks learned the hard way

Don't re-derive these. Check here first.

### Hardhat 3 (`hardhat@3.x` with `npx hardhat node`)
- `npx hardhat node` uses the network named **`default`**, NOT `hardhat`. Setting `chainId` on the `hardhat` network in config does nothing. To get a non-default chainId, run `npx hardhat --network hardhat node`. Run script does this.
- Default in-memory chainId is **31337**. Viem's `localhost` chain (which the ENS app uses) is **1337**. We standardised on 1337 so they match. If the test wallet's chainId differs from RPC's, `eth_sendRawTransaction` rejects with "invalid chainId".
- Hardhat 3 doesn't implement `eth_createAccessList` (returns -32004). Viem uses this for gas-tightening; we patched `createAccessList.ts` to swallow that error and return an empty list.
- `eth_estimateGas` with state overrides (3rd param) returns a JSON-parse error "trailing characters". Hardhat doesn't accept state overrides. The fallback in `createAccessList` returning empty avoids this.
- Hardhat's block.timestamp drifts ahead of wall-clock after every `evm_increaseTime`. The advance is permanent for the node session. Fresh restart resets it. Frontend's CountdownCircle compares `block.timestamp*1000` against `Date.now()`, so big drift breaks the wait.

### viem batching
- viem batches reads via Multicall3's `aggregate3` (`0x82ad56cb`), **NOT `tryAggregate`**. Our mock must implement both. Symptom: every read fails with Hardhat "Internal error" → wagmi shows `data: undefined`.

### ENS app local dev expectations
- `useEthPrice` hardcodes `eth-usd.data.eth` — must be registered locally with addr → DummyOracle. Without it, the Pricing-step Next button is disabled forever ("Loading"). Deploy script handles this.
- `localhost` chain in ENS app's frontend config = chainId 1337. Resolver address tables in `src/constants/{resolverAddressData,tldData}.ts` key off `'1337'`. If you change one, change all.

### Process hygiene
- Always `pkill -9 -f "hardhat\|next\|playwright"` AND `lsof -ti :8545 :3000 | xargs -r kill -9` before restarting the stack. Background playwright runs from prior turns will silently re-grep the same test you're trying to run now.
- `pnpm dev` Fast Refresh can get stuck in a reload loop after many code edits in the same session — `rm -rf ens-app-v3/.next` between major restarts.
- `bash scripts/run-local.sh` must run from `/work/simplex-namespace-contract/` (it doesn't `cd` to repo root).

### PublicResolver `trustedETHController` parameter
- PublicResolver constructor takes `(ENS, INameWrapper, trustedETHController, trustedReverseRegistrar)`. SNRC is wrapper-free, so pass `address(0)` for the **NameWrapper** slot (its wrapper-auth branch is then never taken). But do **not** pass zero for **trustedETHController**: that means the controller cannot write resolver records during `register()` (register reverts deep in `multicallWithNodeCheck` when `registration.data` is non-empty). So deploy the controller FIRST, then the resolver with the controller address as `trustedETHController`.
- Same applies to `trustedReverseRegistrar`. We pass the ReverseRegistrar address there.

### Playwright fixture playbook (steal from ens-app-v3)
- `ens-app-v3/playwright/fixtures/time.ts` already solves the wall-clock vs block-clock issue: `page.clock.install({ time: blockTimestamp })` overrides browser `Date.now()` to match chain time, then `page.clock.runFor(ms)` + `testClient.increaseTime` advance both in lockstep. Use this pattern instead of `await page.waitForTimeout(60000)`.
- `ens-app-v3/e2e/specs/stateless/registerName.spec.ts` is a 2391-line existing test for the full registration flow. Before writing custom e2e tests from scratch, check whether an adapted ENS spec covers the same flow — that's likely the lower-diff path long-term.

### Stateful test names
- Hardhat runs in a single shared session — names registered by one test persist for the rest of the suite. Either use unique per-run name (e.g. `reg${Date.now().toString(36)}`) or reset chain state between tests. Symptom: a test passes when run alone but fails in suite (the previously-registered name is no longer `available`).
